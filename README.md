# Covid-19-
Covid-19 is the most pertinent data right now. I made a tableau dashboard to visualize the confirmed cases, death totals and the countries severely impacted by the pandemic.I would like to thank #tableau for providing this open source, in order to make your own dashboards and visualizations. The dashboard has been inspired by #AnthonyBSmoak.
